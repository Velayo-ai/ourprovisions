## LOG

### June 11, 2026 — Delete verb (client side) + pre-merge cleanup
**Goal:** Implement client-side Delete for custom catalog items; strip debug artifacts before dev→main merge.
**Completed:**
- Rewired `deleteItem` in `useProvisions.js` to call `delete_custom_catalog_item` RPC (hard-delete + reference cascade server-side); added `is_global` guard refusing deletion of seed items; optimistic UI removal with `prevCatalogRef` snapshot rollback on error
- Removed dead `pendingWrites` ref (orphaned by prior debug-log removal)
- Added Delete button to Edit Item modal footer — custom items only, `window.confirm` gate, left-slot placement, taupe-red text style
- Fixed `isCustom` discriminator in `openEditModal`: `created_by != null` → `is_global === false` (canonical discriminator, reliably present in all catalog read paths)
- Added `deletedIdsRef` poll guard in `loadListItems`: prevents 2-second poll from transiently re-adding a just-deleted item during the RPC round-trip; wired into `deleteItem` (mark before RPC, unmark on rollback)
- Stripped 6 debug `console.log` statements from `useProvisions.js`
**Unfinished:**
- `delete_custom_catalog_item` SECURITY DEFINER RPC not yet written in Supabase — client is wired and ready, server-side is the remaining piece before Delete can ship
**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Write `delete_custom_catalog_item` RPC in Supabase, cold-test Delete end-to-end, then cold-test sync fix and merge dev → main.
State: Client-side Delete fully implemented on `dev`. RPC call is wired but will error until the server-side function exists. Hide is stable. `dev` is clean.
Done when: Delete works end-to-end on both clients (custom item only, list cascade confirmed, no ghost re-add on poll); cold cross-user test passes; `dev` merged to `main` and live.
**Files updated:** `src/hooks/useProvisions.js`, `src/App.js`
**DB changes:** None (RPC not yet written)

### June 10, 2026 — Repo housekeeping & handoff bridge
**Goal:** Clean up repo structure and wire the design→implementation handoff path.
**Completed:**
- Moved `src/docs/` → `docs/` and `src/handoff/` → `handoff/` (repo root); updated all path references in CLAUDE.md and the docs themselves
- Tracked `tools/` (velayo OS flight checklist)
- Added `handoff/.gitignore` (`*` / `!.gitignore`) so transient `design_handoff.md` files are never accidentally committed
- Added `.gitattributes` to normalize all text files to LF; renormalized existing files
- Removed `src/App_legacy.js` backup (unused)
**Unfinished:** None
**Next session:** —
**Knowledge updated:** CLAUDE.md (all `src/docs/` → `docs/` refs, Step 5 git-add path), ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, SESSION_LOG.md

### June 9, 2026 — Implement Hide verb + fix poll/boot races
**Goal:** Wire up per-user Hide (per SPEC_hide_delete) and eliminate the two root causes of hidden items reappearing.
**Completed:**
- Added `hideItem` function to `useProvisions.js` — inserts into `user_hidden_items`, optimistic local removal of item from `catalogMap`/`catalogRef`/`quantities`, rollback on error; exported from hook return object
- Repointed all three `SwipeToRemove` `onRemove` handlers in `App.js` from `deleteItem` to `hideItem`
- Renamed "Remove" → "Hide" in SwipeToRemove action row and swipe-reveal; recolored from red (`#e05c5c`) to warm taupe (`#8A7968`); Staple button non-staple state stays slate (`#6B7E8F`)
- Updated Add Item restore-hidden copy: "select to reset" → "tap below to unhide"; "restored" → "items unhidden"; button now shows count-aware "Unhide N hidden {category} item(s)"
- Fixed poll re-adding hidden items: added `hiddenIdsRef.current.has()` guard in `loadListItems` in both the `catalogRef.current` forEach and the `setCatalogMap` forEach — hidden items are now skipped on every 2-second poll tick
- Removed `await refreshCatalog()` from `hideItem` try block (optimistic removal + poll guard is sufficient; the full re-fetch caused flicker)
- Fixed boot effect stacked-poll race: added `getTokenRef` to hold the latest Clerk `getToken` without re-triggering the effect; removed `getToken` from the `useEffect` dependency array — effect now only fires on `userId`/`clerkId`/`email`/`fullName` changes
- Added 3 temporary debug `console.log` lines to diagnose any remaining catalog repopulation path

**Unfinished:**
- Debug logs still present (remove after confirming hide is stable cross-user)
- Delete verb not yet implemented (custom items, household-wide, cascades to list)
- Cold cross-user test of Hide still needed

**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Confirm hide is stable across two users; remove debug logs; begin Delete verb.
State: Hide is wired. Boot race fixed. Poll guard in place. 3 debug logs in `useProvisions.js` (loadListItems, hideItem, refreshCatalog).
Done when: Hide survives 2-second poll on both clients with no reappearance; debug logs removed; Delete verb spec'd or started.

**Files updated:** `src/hooks/useProvisions.js`, `src/App.js`
**DB changes:** None (user_hidden_items table pre-existing)

### June 8, 2026 — Fix multi-user list sync (OurProvisions)
**Completed:**
- Rendered SHOP list from raw RPC rows (`listRows`) instead of `catalogMap`, so synced items (e.g. Bakery) appear on every client regardless of local catalog state
- Removed per-user `hiddenIdsRef` filter from the `listRows` loop — catalog hides must not suppress shared active list items
- Removed now-unused `addedByMap` from App.js destructuring; build passes clean
- Added `docs/` to repo: SESSION_LOG, ROADMAP, SPEC_hide_delete

**Unfinished:**
- SPEC_hide_delete implementation (hide/delete rework per spec)

**Next session:**
- Implement SPEC_hide_delete: per-user hide via `user_hidden_items`, hard-delete for custom items, restore flow

**Knowledge updated:**
- `listRows` is now the source of truth for the SHOP list; `catalogMap` is catalog-browse only

### June 2026 — Velayo OS Foundation
**Completed:** 
- Built complete Claude OS framework (project structure, hygiene rules, session templates)
- Clarified model strategy: Sonnet as default, Opus for hard problems
- Mapped first agent: Session Scribe
- Created all four Velayo OS base documents (VELAYO_BRIEF, CLAUDE_OS, ROADMAP, SESSION_LOG)

**Unfinished:** 
- OurProvisions Project Knowledge audit
- Session Scribe v1 build

**Next session:** 
- Build Session Scribe v1 as a prompt-based tool in Velayo OS project
- Audit OurProvisions Project Knowledge

**Knowledge updated:** 
- All four base documents created fresh tonight
