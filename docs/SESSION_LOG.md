### 2026-06-12 — OurProvisions — Dev DB sandbox + catalog propagation + Browse tab UI overhaul
**Goal:** Stand up isolated dev database, fix cross-client catalog propagation, and overhaul the Browse tab UI.
**Completed:**
- Set up isolated dev Supabase project (`zxwtxjjmssykhqrghouf`); repointed Vercel Preview to dev; reconciled four prod/file schema drifts into `003_apply.sql`, `007_functions.sql`, `008_policies.sql`; configured Clerk Third-Party Auth on dev project.
- Fixed catalog propagation: guarded-merge `refreshCatalog` (respects `hiddenIdsRef`/`deletedIdsRef`, commits only on real field-level diff); added `refreshCatalogRef` for stable closure access; wired 20s `catalogPollInterval` alongside the 2s list poll.
- Replaced direct `list_items`/`catalog_items` writes with SECURITY DEFINER RPCs (`insert_custom_catalog_item`, `insert_list_item`); switched list read to `get_list_items_for_household` RPC (inline name/category/is_staple); removed `pendingWrites` guard that was blocking cross-user poll visibility.
- Built Browse tab UI: real-time search bar, wrapping category chip filters, two-layer `displayCategories` (staples cross-cut → chips narrow), no-match row with category picker and inline new-category creation.
- Removed `CUSTOM_CAT = "⭐ My Custom Items"` constant entirely from App.js and useProvisions.js; all fallbacks replaced with `"Household"`.
- Fixed pre-existing build failures (duplicate declarations, merge conflict markers, unused `realtimeSub`); stabilized splash screen timer (empty deps array + `useCallback`).
- Merged `dev` → `main` (fast-forward), pushed both; production green at `9a3008d` — Hide/Delete/propagation features live.
**Unfinished:**
- Prod schema diverges from migration files on four axes (undocumented tables/columns, 15+ RPCs, RLS rewrite) — prod works, files are not canonical; clean rewrite not yet done.
- Background-tab sync lags (~60s) due to browser `setInterval` throttling on unfocused tabs — accepted as non-issue for foreground use.
**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Regenerate a clean, canonical migration set from prod's actual live state.
State: Catalog propagation shipped to prod. Dev sandbox isolated and functional. Migration files `001`–`006` are behind prod; `003_apply`/`007_functions`/`008_policies` exist as dev-only patches.
Done when: A migration set that reproduces prod's real schema (tables, columns, RPCs, RLS) from scratch exists in repo, validated by a clean dev rebuild.
**Files updated:** `src/hooks/useProvisions.js`, `src/App.js`
**DB changes:** Dev only — `003_apply.sql`, `007_functions.sql`, `008_policies.sql` applied; RLS disabled on `provision_cycles`/`shopping_sessions`/`known_stores`; soft-deleted duplicate `household_members` row. Prod: code-only deploy.

### 2026-06-11 — Velayo OS — Build & ship The Harbour + harden the SESSION END pipeline
**Goal:** Stand up a company "intranet" — refined into a private, push-to-deploy founder operating dashboard ("The Harbour") gated to crew only — then resolve the resulting logging-pipeline conflict.
**Completed:**
- Designed The Harbour: a four-lane balance instrument (Business Foundation / Product / Marketing / Sales & Support), not a link launchpad. Cold-signal hierarchy: neglect detector loudest, then priority, owner, tools.
- Added a leverage gauge — 1 human : tasks run by agents, goal 1:20, summed from per-lane agent counts. Separated the "intelligence layer" (C-suite Claude projects = advice) from the ratio (keeps the number honest and un-inflatable).
- Built + shipped: new repo `Velayo-ai/velayo-os` (private), Git-wired to Cloudflare (push-to-deploy), custom domain `harbour.velayo.ai` (HTTPS), gated with Cloudflare Access (OTP, "Crew only" policy). Verified end-to-end in incognito.
- Decided repo architecture: OS stays its own repo, separate from `velayo-platform` and app repos. Cockpit ≠ engine.
- Resolved the SESSION END conflict: retired v1 chat-Scribe (Drive-writing) in favor of v2 (chat emits handoff → Claude Code merges canonical docs). One record, chat is a feeder.
- Added scope tagging to CLAUDE.md SESSION END routine ([SCOPE] = OurProvisions / Velayo OS / Platform / Cross) so the single rolling log stays one narrative now but splits cleanly later.
**Unfinished:**
- Harbour placeholders: C-suite seat URLs, tool chips (Banking, Cap table, Social, Brand deck), and lane content (priorities, agent counts, "moved Xd ago" dates) are all illustrative — need a real first pass.
- v1 chat-Scribe language still lives in this project's instructions + `VELAYO_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md` — needs the v2 "produce a handoff" replacement.
- Company-log-in-app-repo is a conscious interim choice; split into `velayo-os/docs` at the trigger (app #2's first session).
**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Wire The Harbour's live data + retire v1 Scribe language.
State: Harbour live + gated at harbour.velayo.ai, push-to-deploy via velayo-os. CLAUDE.md scope-tagging committed. Placeholders throughout the dashboard.
Done when: C-suite seats open the right Claude projects; tool chips resolve; lane data reflects reality; pushed live; project instructions + template updated to v2 handoff-producer language.
**Files updated:** `velayo-os/index.html`, `velayo-os/velayo_os_flight_checklist.html`, `CLAUDE.md` (scope tagging)
**DB changes:** None

### 2026-06-11 — OurProvisions — Add [SCOPE] tag to session log infrastructure
**Goal:** Add a [SCOPE] field to CLAUDE.md so the single rolling session log can distinguish OurProvisions / Velayo OS / Platform / Cross work and support a future per-repo split.
**Completed:**
- Added `[SCOPE]` slot to `SESSION LOG ENTRY FORMAT` header (`### [YYYY-MM-DD] — [SCOPE] — [GOAL]`)
- Appended scope-tagging paragraph to Step 1 of SESSION END routine (defines four values; explains why a filter beats a migration)
- Added scope discipline bullet to Rules (directs against filing OS/Platform work as OurProvisions history; flags future velayo-os log)
- Committed all three surgical edits (`8396b8e`, `dev`)
**Unfinished:** None
**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Stand up dev DB sandbox, THEN fix catalog propagation.
State: Delete verb (client side) done; `delete_custom_catalog_item` RPC not yet deployed; catalog propagation cross-client broken (catalog loaded once at boot, not on poll); ESLint exhaustive-deps warning present; dev NOT merged to main.
Done when: dev DB isolated (Supabase branch + Vercel env repointed); custom catalog adds + catalog-only deletes propagate cross-client within a poll cycle; lint clean; dev merged to main.
**Files updated:** `CLAUDE.md`
**DB changes:** None

### June 11, 2026 — Delete verb (client side) + pre-merge cleanup
**Goal:** Implement client-side Delete for custom catalog items; strip debug artifacts before dev→main merge.
**Completed:**
- Rewired `deleteItem` in `useProvisions.js` to call `delete_custom_catalog_item` RPC (hard-delete + reference cascade server-side); added `is_global` guard refusing deletion of seed items; optimistic UI removal with `prevCatalogRef` snapshot rollback on error
- Removed dead `pendingWrites` ref (orphaned by prior debug-log removal)
- Added Delete button to Edit Item modal footer — custom items only, `window.confirm` gate, left-slot placement, taupe-red text style
- Fixed `isCustom` discriminator in `openEditModal`: `created_by != null` → `is_global === false` (canonical discriminator, reliably present in all catalog read paths)
- Added `deletedIdsRef` poll guard in `loadListItems`: prevents 2-second poll from transiently re-adding a just-deleted item during the RPC round-trip; wired into `deleteItem` (mark before RPC, unmark on rollback)
- Stripped 6 debug `console.log` statements from `useProvisions.js`
**Unfinished:**
- Catalog propagation across clients is broken (DIAGNOSED, not fixed): custom items created on one client don't appear on others until hard-reload. Root cause: the 2s poll refreshes LIST state only; the catalog_items read runs once at boot, never on the interval. Confirmed live (proptest1 created on DT never reached DH).
- ESLint exhaustive-deps warning on the boot effect — still present, blocks main merge.
- dev NOT merged to main (gated on the two items above).
- Note: dev preview + Supabase SQL Editor both currently run against PRODUCTION (main); no isolated dev DB branch exists. This session's test deletes hit prod (throwaway items only).
**Next session (SESSION START):**
Goal: Stand up a dev DB sandbox, THEN fix catalog propagation against it.
Order: (1) Create Supabase `dev` branch + repoint Vercel preview env vars to it — stop testing against prod. (2) Fix catalog propagation (separate slower catalog poll + harden refreshCatalog into a guarded merge; it currently does a full setCatalogMap replace and ignores deletedIdsRef). (3) Resolve ESLint exhaustive-deps warning. (4) Merge dev → main.
Done when: dev DB isolated; custom catalog adds + catalog-only deletes propagate cross-client within a poll cycle; lint clean; dev merged to main.
**Files updated:** `src/hooks/useProvisions.js`, `src/App.js`
**DB changes:** `delete_custom_catalog_item` SECURITY DEFINER RPC deployed and tested

### June 10, 2026 — Repo housekeeping & handoff bridge
**Goal:** Clean up repo structure and wire the design→implementation handoff path.
**Completed:**
- Moved `src/docs/` → `docs/` and `src/handoff/` → `handoff/` (repo root); updated all path references in CLAUDE.md and the docs themselves
- Tracked `tools/` (velayo OS flight checklist)
- Added `handoff/.gitignore` (`*` / `!.gitignore`) so transient `design_handoff.md` files are never accidentally committed
- Added `.gitattributes` to normalize all text files to LF; renormalized existing files
- Removed `src/App_legacy.js` backup (unused)
**Unfinished:** None
**Next session:** —
**Knowledge updated:** CLAUDE.md (all `src/docs/` → `docs/` refs, Step 5 git-add path), ARCHITECTURE.md, ROADMAP.md, SESSION_LOG.md

### June 9, 2026 — Implement Hide verb + fix poll/boot races
**Goal:** Wire up per-user Hide (per SPEC_hide_delete) and eliminate the two root causes of hidden items reappearing.
**Completed:**
- Added `hideItem` function to `useProvisions.js` — inserts into `user_hidden_items`, optimistic local removal of item from `catalogMap`/`catalogRef`/`quantities`, rollback on error; exported from hook return object
- Repointed all three `SwipeToRemove` `onRemove` handlers in `App.js` from `deleteItem` to `hideItem`
- Renamed "Remove" → "Hide" in SwipeToRemove action row and swipe-reveal; recolored from red (`#e05c5c`) to warm taupe (`#8A7968`); Staple button non-staple state stays slate (`#6B7E8F`)
- Updated Add Item restore-hidden copy: "select to reset" → "tap below to unhide"; "restored" → "items unhidden"; button now shows count-aware "Unhide N hidden {category} item(s)"
- Fixed poll re-adding hidden items: added `hiddenIdsRef.current.has()` guard in `loadListItems` in both the `catalogRef.current` forEach and the `setCatalogMap` forEach — hidden items are now skipped on every 2-second poll tick
- Removed `await refreshCatalog()` from `hideItem` try block (optimistic removal + poll guard is sufficient; the full re-fetch caused flicker)
- Fixed boot effect stacked-poll race: added `getTokenRef` to hold the latest Clerk `getToken` without re-triggering the effect; removed `getToken` from the `useEffect` dependency array — effect now only fires on `userId`/`clerkId`/`email`/`fullName` changes
- Added 3 temporary debug `console.log` lines to diagnose any remaining catalog repopulation path

**Unfinished:**
- Debug logs still present (remove after confirming hide is stable cross-user)
- Delete verb not yet implemented (custom items, household-wide, cascades to list)
- Cold cross-user test of Hide still needed

**Next session:**
SESSION START
Goal: Confirm hide is stable across two users; remove debug logs; begin Delete verb.
State: Hide is wired. Boot race fixed. Poll guard in place. 3 debug logs in `useProvisions.js` (loadListItems, hideItem, refreshCatalog).
Done when: Hide survives 2-second poll on both clients with no reappearance; debug logs removed; Delete verb spec'd or started.

**Files updated:** `src/hooks/useProvisions.js`, `src/App.js`
**DB changes:** None (user_hidden_items table pre-existing)

### June 8, 2026 — Fix multi-user list sync (OurProvisions)
**Completed:**
- Rendered SHOP list from raw RPC rows (`listRows`) instead of `catalogMap`, so synced items (e.g. Bakery) appear on every client regardless of local catalog state
- Removed per-user `hiddenIdsRef` filter from the `listRows` loop — catalog hides must not suppress shared active list items
- Removed now-unused `addedByMap` from App.js destructuring; build passes clean
- Added `docs/` to repo: SESSION_LOG, ROADMAP, SPEC_hide_delete

**Unfinished:**
- SPEC_hide_delete implementation (hide/delete rework per spec)

**Next session:**
- Implement SPEC_hide_delete: per-user hide via `user_hidden_items`, hard-delete for custom items, restore flow

**Knowledge updated:**
- `listRows` is now the source of truth for the SHOP list; `catalogMap` is catalog-browse only

### June 2026 — Velayo OS Foundation
**Completed:** 
- Built complete Claude OS framework (project structure, hygiene rules, session templates)
- Clarified model strategy: Sonnet as default, Opus for hard problems
- Mapped first agent: Session Scribe
- Created all four Velayo OS base documents (VELAYO_BRIEF, CLAUDE_OS, ROADMAP, SESSION_LOG)

**Unfinished:** 
- OurProvisions Project Knowledge audit
- Session Scribe v1 build

**Next session:** 
- Build Session Scribe v1 as a prompt-based tool in Velayo OS project
- Audit OurProvisions Project Knowledge

**Knowledge updated:** 
- All four base documents created fresh tonight
